In addition, more and more travelers tend to have personalized travel plan instead of mass tour group products. For example, in 2017, more than 135 million Chinese are projected to travel abroad, making China the world’s largest outbound travel market, and 70 percent of Chinese outbound travelers plan to either make their own travel arrangements or buy a travel package but travel on their own for their next overseas trip (Skift Report 2017)[^1].

So, instead of traditional travel agencies (TA) offering group tour service, more and more independent travelers are interested in service from online travel agencies (OTA), such as Expedia, Priceline, Ctrip, Fliggy Alibaba, etc. Especially the personalized tourism products from OTAs, distinguished from the traditional travel packages, which simple include quote of hotel price, airline tickets, and sometimes rental car rate. The personalized tourism products would be a combination of almost anything you need in a travel, including the recommendation of interesting travel destinations, hotel and transportation, tickets of local places of interests and events, restaurants recommendations and coupons, local travel guild, personal online assistant while traveling, social events, etc. 

However, nowadays, most OTAs are still displaying the traditional travel packages. There are not enough integrated online tourism products meeting the needs of those emerging independent travelers, who is looking for tourism products with novelty, convenience, flexibility, and personalization. Therefore, if OTAs can have a data science team and utilize the data from the travelers’ online footprints and provided personized tourism products to them, it would create huge benefits for travelers, OTAs and destination local communities.


## Data from Digital World Can Help OTAs Identify the Hot Travel Destinations.

There must be a large amount of data that we, an OTA data science team, can utilize to understand the tourists better and have smarter decisions. The data source can be the review data from travel websites (TripAdvisor, Meituan-Dianping, Yelp, etc.), the recent travel-related hot topics in social media (Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, WeChat, QQ, etc.), airline arrangement and change, local events, statistic reports from Tourism Department, global economy, security and exchange rate volatility, etc. The object of the data science work is to use those data online and figure out trending travel destinations and targeting groups of tourists.  

As for the technologies, Nature Language Processing with Deep Learning will be the key of the project, since most data source comes as unstructured nature language. Statistic technics and Machine Learning tools will also be used to analyze Tourism Department data, airline data, and local events data. 

To conceptualize the project, in the first stage of the project, we can focus on identifying the hot travel destinations. And operational metrics of the hot travel destination can be a comprehensive score measuring multiple aspects, such as distance from the tourists, frequency of being positively mentioned in the social media within a given period, review scores, airline arrangement, number and quality of events, security score, currency exchange rate, etc. The higher the score, the higher demand that the destination will be. Then the operation team from OTAs can use the analysis results from data science team and pick up those destinations to develop a tourism products and marketing them.    


## A Win-win-win Project for Tourists, OTAs, and Local Communities.

With the help of Data Science technics, the massive data from websites can help OTAs identify high-demand travel destinations and related group of customers; develop the products and price max affordable price to those identified customers, and target marketing those customers; then finally generate revenue and customer loyalty for OTAs, bring economic benefits to local community, and provide happiness and great moments to tourists. 

However, the online social media data we collected make it hard to found attracting destinations that seldom have tourists visited, such as a remoted valley, a peaceful village, etc.  Also, identifying the travel destination is only the first step of the whole project, the next step is to develop attracting tourism products, then have the precision marketing implemented to make sure we reach those identified customers.  

All in all, it must be a win-win-win project for tourists, OTAs, and local communities!

As a data science graduate student and a hotelier for 6 years, I have two ideas about leveraging data science to help Hospitality companies gain better revenue outcome. Figure 1: Data Science for Hospitality – Turning Data into Profit Abstract of my first cool idea - Personalized Service and Pricing for Hotel Loyal Guests Hotel loyalty guests usually bring the most revenue to hotel business. They require more personalized service, which is not always satisfied by the hotel, due to the lack of understanding those guests. However, by utilizing the data science technology, such as machine learning, we, a data science team in hotel company, can make full use of the existing data (reservation, guests’ preference, transaction, public camera pictures, etc.) to know the most valuable hotel guests much better and then provide personalized service to them. Abstract of my second cool idea - Personalized Tourism Products in the Digital Age Thanks to the development of internet, social media and travel websites, more people make travel plan online and tend to have personalized travel plan instead of mass tour group products, which require more tourism products from online travel agencies (OTA). with novelty, convenience, flexibility, and personalization, instead of simple rate quote of hotel price, airline tickets, and sometimes rental car rate. There must be a large amount of data (online review, social media, local events, etc.) that we, an OTA data science team, can utilize to understand the tourists better and have smarter tourism products. About the author I’m the student of Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program at UC Berkeley, passionate about data science in Hospitality industry. As a hotelier for 6 years and an alumna from Cornell Hotel School, I have deep domain knowledge in Hospitality industry, especially in Hotel, Online Travel Agency, and Rental Car industries, focusing on marketing, pricing and strategy making. I believe by leveraging the state of art data science Tec knowledge, I can help hospitality companies generate better business outcome in the short future! Updated: 2017-11-22 "],

Existing Data Plus Data Science Technics can Lead to a Better Understanding of Guests. Promising Results and Limitations.", " Personalized Service and Pricing for Hotel Loyal Guests Keywords Hotel Loyalty Guests, Personalized service, Dynamic Pricing, Revenue Loyalty Program Can Bring More Revnue, if Hotels Know Their Guests Better. More and more hotel groups are promoting attracting loyalty programs, for the top 20% of loyalty guests contribute 80% of the revenue of an average hotel. After the Marriott – Starwood Merger, the world’s biggest hotel group has the most powerful frequent traveler programs in the lodging industry, with 100 million loyal members (Marriott 2016 Annual Report)1. As to independent hotels, companies like the Leading Hotels of the World are offering loyalty programs at luxury independent hotels all over the world. Independent hotels experienced an average 50% increase in annual revenue when customers joined their loyalty programs (Voorhees, C., McCall, M., &amp; Carroll, B. 2014)2. In a word, loyalty programs and loyal guests are playing a more and more important role in hotel business globally, for both hotel groups and independent hotels. Understanding more about those loyal guests can help hotels serve them better and attract new loyal guests to increase current revenue and guarantee future revenue. Although hoteliers try their best to serve guests based on their experience and personal judgement, hotels don’t have powerful tools or systems to have a thorough and aggregated understanding of those high-value guests to achieve the best business outcome. Guests leave unsatisfied, the price of the hotel and the guests’ willing to pay are mismatched, and hotels lose high-value guests. However, mountains of data about those guests is already available in the hotel systems. In order to have a better business outcome, hotels and hotel groups need to utilize data science technologies to increase the quality of personalized service products and have a better customized pricing for high-level loyalty guests. Hotel Loyalty Program Existing Data Plus Data Science Technics can Lead to a Better Understanding of Guests. Because loyalty guests are very easy to track by membership number, there is a lot of data source available to start with. There is reservation data from Property Management System (PMS) for better pricing: booking channels, advance days of booking, reservation change history, type of rooms booked, travel destinations, hotel brands, yearly revenue contribution, etc. PMS also tracks the guests’ preferences for better service: the bedding and pillow, welcome amenity, transportation service, room view, room facility, special needs, F&amp;B purchase, meeting and business service needs, etc. Other available data includes the website browse and click data when members log in to the hotel websites for better marketing campaigns and even the data from hotel cameras in public areas for better hotel design and service: guests’ move flow in the hotel, the size of luggage, the time that active in the public area, etc. Besides the existing data, with the development of AI technology, more and more hotels are providing smart speakers, such as Echo from Amazon, Google Home, mall Genie from Alibaba, etc. The incorporation of smart speakers can provide more interactive data from guests to the hotel. In addition to the in-house data, third-party data sources are also very valuable, such as competitor pricing, online customer reviews, social media, airline information, weather forecast, local events, etc. If all the data mentioned above could be aggregated into one data set and data science technologies were applied (machine learning, deep learning with smart camera network, time series forecasting, etc.), we would have a better understanding of the guests’ needs, preferences, affordable prices, travel purposes, even before they understand themselves. With that deeper understanding of loyalty guests, hotels/hotel groups could send a personal welcome letter before a guest’s arrival, provide unique service before they ask, offer unique and customized price based on their annual revenue contribution, and introduce newly open hotels or products which they must be interested in. For example, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang are taking a vacation with their children in a resort hotel. Since they are the top level loyal guests, their satisfaction can bring a lot of revenue to the hotel group. (1) Before they planned the vacation, the hotel group already send out promotion email showing multiple luxury and upscale resort hotels in the destinations that they may interested in with a unique dynamic price only for their family. The hotel group would know that they took an annual vacation trip at the same period for the last three years and they tend to book hotel two months ahead. (2) Before they arrive, the hotel has already assigned a nice room with welcome fruit and ice cream in their son’s favorite flavor. The room has an ocean view and is far away from the elevator according to their previous room preference, because Mrs. Zhang likes a quite place with nice views. (3) When they are dining in the hotel, according to their diet preference, the hotel can always recommend dishes to meet their satisfaction. (4) The smart speaker in the room can ask for their needs, set their favorite room light, and recommend hotel facilities according to their preference. (5) The camera in the public area can recognize them, understand their facial expression, predict their needs and direction, and inform the related hotel staff to prepare or come to help. (6) After they have a wonderful stay experience at the hotel, all the data for this trip is analyzed and stored in the cloud and used for their next trip. Promising Results and Limitations. Because the hotel/hotel groups provide such a unique and personalized service to the guests based on the data science technology and the price they charge is just at the guests’ affordable level, the guests experience and loyalty retention rate will be improved and hotel revenue will increase enormously. What’s more, with the understanding of current loyalty guests and the market, the hotel can forecast the booming or emerging market demand and offer promotions or campaigns to attract new loyal guests. So, both the current and future revenue will be guaranteed. However, there are still some concerns about the loyalty program improvement using data science technologies. (1) Different people sometimes will use the same loyalty membership card for the benefit of the free upgrade and amenities, meaning one guest’s account would store many different guests’ information. (2) The unique and customized service will increase the cost. So, hotels need to pay attention to the cost and revenue balance by selecting the service level of granularity base on their brand features. (3) Bias of “Law of Small Numbers” may happen when analysising the very high end guests, such as celebrities, guests book presidential, guests with unique preferences, etc. (4) Data privacy is another concern when hotels are trying to know the loyal guests from every possible aspects, especially unique preferences.

["Personalized-Tourism-Products.html", "Personalized Tourism Products in the Digital Age Tourists Require Better Personalized Tourism Products from OTAs in the Digital Age. Data from Digital World Can Help OTAs Identify the Hot Travel Destinations. A Win-win-win Project for Tourists, OTAs, and Local Communities.", " Personalized Tourism Products in the Digital Age Keywords Online Travel Agency (OTA), Travel Destination, Tourism Product, Precision Marketing, Social Media, Nature Language Processing (NLP) Tourists Require Better Personalized Tourism Products from OTAs in the Digital Age. Thanks to the development of internet, social media and travel websites, people have more places of interests around the world to visit, make travel plan online, share happiness and experience to their social network, and motivate the other people to plan for a trip (Skift Report 2017)3. Most-Used Resources for Oversea Trip Planing in 2017 In addition, more and more travelers tend to have personalized travel plan instead of mass tour group products. For example, in 2017, more than 135 million Chinese are projected to travel abroad, making China the world’s largest outbound travel market, and 70 percent of Chinese outbound travelers plan to either make their own travel arrangements or buy a travel package but travel on their own for their next overseas trip (Skift Report 2017)4. Travel Arrangement for Most Recent Trip and Next Trip, May 2017 So, instead of traditional travel agencies (TA) offering group tour service, more and more independent travelers are interested in service from online travel agencies (OTA), such as Expedia, Priceline, Ctrip, Fliggy Alibaba, etc. Especially the personalized tourism products from OTAs, distinguished from the traditional travel packages, which simple include quote of hotel price, airline tickets, and sometimes rental car rate. The personalized tourism products would be a combination of almost anything you need in a travel, including the recommendation of interesting travel destinations, hotel and transportation, tickets of local places of interests and events, restaurants recommendations and coupons, local travel guild, personal online assistant while traveling, social events, etc. However, nowadays, most OTAs are still displaying the traditional travel packages. There are not enough integrated online tourism products meeting the needs of those emerging independent travelers, who is looking for tourism products with novelty, convenience, flexibility, and personalization. Therefore, if OTAs can have a data science team and utilize the data from the travelers’ online footprints and provided personized tourism products to them, it would create huge benefits for travelers, OTAs and destination local communities. Data from Digital World Can Help OTAs Identify the Hot Travel Destinations. There must be a large amount of data that we, an OTA data science team, can utilize to understand the tourists better and have smarter decisions. The data source can be the review data from travel websites (TripAdvisor, Meituan-Dianping, Yelp, etc.), the recent travel-related hot topics in social media (Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, WeChat, QQ, etc.), airline arrangement and change, local events, statistic reports from Tourism Department, global economy, security and exchange rate volatility, etc. The object of the data science work is to use those data online and figure out trending travel destinations and targeting groups of tourists. As for the technologies, Nature Language Processing with Deep Learning will be the key of the project, since most data source comes as unstructured nature language. Statistic technics and Machine Learning tools will also be used to analyze Tourism Department data, airline data, and local events data. To conceptualize the project, in the first stage of the project, we can focus on identifying the hot travel destinations. And operational metrics of the hot travel destination can be a comprehensive score measuring multiple aspects, such as distance from the tourists, frequency of being positively mentioned in the social media within a given period, review scores, airline arrangement, number and quality of events, security score, currency exchange rate, etc. The higher the score, the higher demand that the destination will be. Then the operation team from OTAs can use the analysis results from data science team and pick up those destinations to develop a tourism products and marketing them. A Win-win-win Project for Tourists, OTAs, and Local Communities. With the help of Data Science technics, the massive data from websites can help OTAs identify high-demand travel destinations and related group of customers; develop the products and price max affordable price to those identified customers, and target marketing those customers; then finally generate revenue and customer loyalty for OTAs, bring economic benefits to local community, and provide happiness and great moments to tourists. However, the online social media data we collected make it hard to found attracting destinations that seldom have tourists visited, such as a remoted valley, a peaceful village, etc. Also, identifying the travel destination is only the first step of the whole project, the next step is to develop attracting tourism products, then have the precision marketing implemented to make sure we reach those identified customers. All in all, it must be a win-win-win project for tourists, OTAs, and local communities! Skift. (2017). Skift. 5 Charts Showing the Rise of Independent Chinese Travelers..

Welcome to my portfolio! As a data science graduate student and a hotelier for six years, I have two ideas about leveraging data science to help Hospitality companies gain better revenue outcome.

### Abstract of my first cool idea - Personalized Service and Pricing for Hotel Loyal Guests

Hotel loyalty guests usually bring the most revenue to hotel business. They require more personalized service, which is not always satisfied by the hotel, due to the lack of understanding those guests. However, by utilizing the data science technology, such as machine learning, we, a data science team in hotel company, can make full use of the existing data (reservation, guests' preference, transaction, public camera pictures, etc.) to know the most valuable hotel guests much better and then provide personalized service to them.
 

### Abstract of my second cool idea - Personalized Tourism Products in the Digital Age

Thanks to the development of internet, social media and travel websites, more people make travel plan online and tend to have personalized travel plan instead of mass tour group products, which require more tourism products from online travel agencies (OTA). with novelty, convenience, flexibility, and personalization, instead of simple rate quote of hotel price, airline tickets, and sometimes rental car rate. There must be a large amount of data (online review, social media, local events, etc.) that we, an OTA data science team, can utilize to understand the tourists better and have smarter tourism products.
